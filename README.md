# CMIP6 time series

This repository contains an archive of global means of some CMIP6 diagnostics (I suppose `tas` is the one that most people are interested in). I am planning to keep it more or less up to date, at least until KNMI starts ingesting CMIP6 data.

# Acknowledgments

Kudos to the World Climate Research Programme, which, through its Working Group on Coupled Modelling, coordinated and promoted CMIP6; and to the climate modeling groups for producing and making available their model output, the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) for archiving the data and providing access, and the multiple funding agencies who support CMIP6 and ESGF.
